# Heart-disease-prediction---ML-Project

This Machine learning model is a classification model , based on the given dataset(Kaggle dataset). 

It analysis and predicts the heart disease based on the patients report.

In this we have used data engineering to reduce the features ( 13 feature set to 9 feature set) as it affects the accuracy of the machine learning model.

Our dataset will suit for linear , if changed to non -linear , it will affect the accuracy of the model prediction.

Our prediction is based on classification report and confusion matrix.
